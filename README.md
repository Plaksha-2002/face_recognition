# Face Recognition Attendance System

This project includes developing an attendance system that uses facial recognition to track user's attendance and time-in. In the this system, the process flow is initiated by being able to detect
the facial features from a camera or a picture store in a memory. The algorithm processes the image
captured and identifies the number of faces in the image by analyzing from the learned pattern and
compare them to filter out the rest. This image processing uses multiple algorithm that takes facial
features and compare them with known database.
It addresses topics such as facial detection, recognition, new student registration, photo addition to the training dataset, viewing attendance reports, and so on. This project aims to be an efficient replacement for traditional manual attendance systems. It is suitable for use in corporate offices, schools, and institutions where security is critical.


Face Recognition Algorithms -
• Haar Cascade
• LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram)
